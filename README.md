# Start of Machine Learning (ML) 

## By an simple example 
### Through the example we will:
    - Look at the big picture 
    - How to get the data 
    - Discover and visualize the data --> inorder to get an insight about the problem that is addressed 
    - Preprocessing --> Prepairing data for ML algorithm 
    - Selecting a model and training it 
    - Finetune the model 
    - Present the solution 

#### Importent to work with real data 
Here are a few places you can look to get data: 
            • Popular open data repositories:
                — UC Irvine Machine Learning Repositor
                — Kaggle datasets
                — Amazon’s AWS datasets
            • Meta portals (they list open data repositories):
                — http://dataportals.org/
                — http://opendatamonitor.eu/
                — http://quandl.com/
            • Other pages listing many popular open data repositories:
                — Wikipedia’s list of Machine Learning datasets
                — Quora.com question
                — Datasets subreddit
                # In this class, we will use the California Housing Prices from the StatLib repository
